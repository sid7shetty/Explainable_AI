To perform the tasks you've mentioned in Python, you can use the pandas library for data manipulation and
scikit-learn for data scaling. First, make sure you have these libraries installed.
If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip:

Now, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the data from the CSV file and create a DataFrame.
2. Print the dimensions (shape) of the DataFrame.
3. Print the column names.
4. Select the values of the "age" column into an array.
5. Compute the year of the age values.
6. Compute the mean, maximum, and minimum of the age values.
7. Split the data into training and test datasets.
8. Scale the data using the StandardScaler.



To create a Logistic Regression model, train it, make predictions, compare the predicted output with the real values,
print feature importance, and visualize feature importance in a bar chart, you can follow the steps below. 
Make sure you have already loaded your dataset and split it into training and test sets as shown earlier.
We will assume you're using scikit-learn and matplotlib for visualization. If you haven't imported these libraries, 
you can do so at the beginning of your script.

In this code:

- We create a Logistic Regression model, train it on the training data, and then make predictions on the test data.
- We calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions and print it.
- We print the importance of each feature in the model.
- We print the feature values for one sample (proband).
- We visualize feature importance using a horizontal bar chart.
